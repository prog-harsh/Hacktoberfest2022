Reverse Linked List

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
Example 2:


Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]


// Time Complexity: O(n), Linear - traverse linked list only once
// Space Complexity: O(1), Constant - we will only have 2 pointers regardless of size of input; prev and temp

var reverseList = function(head) {
    // End of the reversed linked list set to null
    let prev = null;
    
    // Traverse through the given linked list
    while (head) {
        const temp = head.next;     // References the next Node of given linked list
        head.next = prev;       // head.next point to previous Node, instead of the next Node of the given linked list
        prev = head;        // Move the prev Node pointer up to head
        head = temp;        // Move the head up to next Node of the given linked list
    }
    
    // Prev is the reversed linked list
    return prev;
};
